Script that reloads the page on the browser when changes are detected on the targeted files to keep track of; similar to a Live Server. Changes are detected only if the file size changes with respect to the last modification.

## Getting Started
Copy the folder "_wparp" into the root of your project, then open "_wparp/auto_reload.js" and in the end of the file set and run the algorithm, like this

```
wparp.pollingFiles(["../index.html"]);
wparp.start();
```

Also add the script to the HTML page to reload

```
<script src="_wparp/auto_reload.js"></script>
```

You can also test with the included sample by opening index.html from PHP localhost.

### Prerequisites
You need a PHP server to run your project on localhost.
